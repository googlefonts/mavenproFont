# Maven Pro
by Joe Prince

Maven Pro is a sans-serif typeface with unique curvature and flowing rhythm. Its forms make it very distinguishable and legible when in context. It blends styles of many great typefaces and is suitable for any design medium. Maven Proâ€™s modern design is great for the web and fits in any environment.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you particularly want to build fonts manually on your own computer, you will need to install the [`yq` utility](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). On OS X with Homebrew, type `brew install yq`; on Linux, try `snap install yq`; if all else fails, try the instructions on the linked page.

Then:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.
